        <p>What is a starfish? According to the Dictionary of Merriam-Webster, a starfish is "any of a class (Asteroidea) of echinoderms that have a body usually five arms radically arranged about a central disk and feed largely on mollusks (such as oysters) -- called also a <em>sea star</em>"(Merriam-Webster). To put it in simplier terms, a starfish is an aquatic animal that has a physical appearance in the form of a central disk surrounded by five arms of equivalent length. Through these two descriptions, a starfish (or sea star) is uniquely identified by its physical appearance and its aquatic environment to both animals and humans alike that have seen one or many of them before. Although most starfishs live on the ocean floors in the wild, there are domestic starfishes that live in aquariums that people view from a distance. The pictures above are examples of different starfishes living in different aquariums. Outside of the aquariums, photographers are able to get snapshots of these starfishes through their digital cameras being placed outside the aquatic environment or above it. The snapshot allows the photographer to remember his or her experience with the starfish and save it for future memories. Another observation that can be taken from these photographs is that each starfish has a different color. This means that a starfish can also camouflage itself to protect itself from other sea creatures.</p>
